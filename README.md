# cppcutils

The goal of cppcutils is to package a couple commonly used workflows
when processing data.

## Installation

Installs locally, need to figure out why this doesn’t work\!

You can install with:

``` r
remotes::install_github('cougphenomics/cppcutils')
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date.
