# cppcutils


The goal of cppcutils is to package a couple commonly used workflows when processing data.

## Installation

Installs locally, need to figure out why this doesn't work!

You can install with:

``` r
remotes::install_github('cougphenomics/cppcutils')
```



What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.
